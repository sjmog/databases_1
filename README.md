# Databases 1 (40 minutes)

An exercise to learn three things:

1. Infer a domain from code
2. Infer database structure from classes
3. Diagram database structure

## Instructions

#### Starter (10 minutes)

Collaboratively define the definitions in [this document](definitions.md).

#### Main (20 minutes)

You have two classes that constitute a domain, with a mix of computed and property methods (including relations). You must diagram the underlying database structure of these classes.

#### Plenary (10 minutes)

Come together to discuss the diagrams drawn.
